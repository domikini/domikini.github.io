# CentOS / RHEL 7 : How to create custom script to run automatically during boot as a systemd service
Reference: https://www.thegeekdiary.com/centos-rhel-7-how-to-make-custom-script-to-run-automatically-during-boot/

In RHEL 5 and 6, we were using automatic startup feature of RHEL through /etc/rc.d/init.d to run any script at system boot. Starting with RHEL 7 init is replaced by systemd and the prior method is now deprecated. There is another way in RHEL 7 to do the same.

## Creating the custom script
1. Let us first create a sample custom script to be run at system boot automatically.

    `vi /var/tmp/test_script.sh`

    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "This is a sample script to test auto run during boot" > /var/tmp/script.out
    echo "The time the script run was -->  `date`" >> /var/tmp/script.out
    ```

2. Check and verify the file permission.
 
    `ls -lrt /usr/local/sbin/myscript.sh`

3. Add execute permission(if itâ€™s not already set).

    `chmod +x /var/tmp/test_script.sh`
    
## Creating new systemd service unit
Create a new service unit file at /etc/systemd/system/sample.service with below content. The name of the service unit is user defined and can be any name of your choice.

    `vi /etc/systemd/system/sample.service`


    [Unit]
    Description=Description for sample script goes here
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/var/tmp/test_script.sh
    TimeoutStartSec=0
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target


After= : If the script needs any other system facilities (networking, etc), modify the [Unit] section to include appropriate After=, Wants=, or Requires= directives.
Type= : Switch Type=simple for Type=idle in the [Service] section to delay execution of the script until all other jobs are dispatched
WantedBy= : target to run the sample script in

## Enable the systemd service unit

1. Reload the systemd process to consider newly created sample.service OR every time when sample.service gets modified.

    `systemctl daemon-reload`

2. Enable this service to start after reboot automatically.

    `systemctl enable sample.service`

3. Start the service.

    `systemctl start sample.service`
    
4. Reboot the host to verify whether the scripts are starting as expected during system boot.

    `systemctl reboot`
