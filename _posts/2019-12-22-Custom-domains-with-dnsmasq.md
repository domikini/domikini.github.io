# Custom domains with dnsmasq

## About

With dnsmasq you are able to create custom domains within your network or route existing domains to different ip's. It's very handy when you want to create  _home_  web which will have web links to your NAS storage, printer and other clever things within your household. This can be also used to block access to domains by routing them to different ip address, so you can block advertising within some applications.

## Adjust router configuration

1.  Go to  `Administration -> System`
2.  Enable:  `Enable JFFS custom scripts and configs`  config option
3.  Enable:  `Enable SSH`  config option
4.  Go to  `LAN -> DNS Filter`  (`Parental Controls -> DNSFilter`  on older models)
5.  Disable:  `Enable DNS-based Filtering`

## Adjust DHCP Server Options

1.  Go to  `LAN -> DHCP Server`
2.  `DNS Server 1`  should contain your router's IP address
3.  If  `Advertise routers IP in addition to user specified DNS`  is enabled all custom DNS address will be appended to the address list given to the clients when they lease an IP address. So if you want to be able to resolve names without specifying the router's address as the name server to do the resolution then make sure this setting is turned off.
4.  Turn off  `Forward local domain queries to upstream DNS`  to prevent your private DNS resolution requests from being passed to the Internet.

## Connect to your router

Connect to your router through SSH (you can use PUTTY on windows). Default IP address is  `192.168.1.1`, use credentials as in web interface. ([How to use putty](https://www.google.sk/search?q=how%20to%20use%20putty))

## Edit dnsmasq config options

1.  Create configuration file for dnsmasq:  `touch /jffs/configs/dnsmasq.conf.add`
    
2.  Edit configuration file:  `vi /jffs/configs/dnsmasq.conf.add`.
    
    -   for typing press  `I`, to quit typing press  `ESC`, to delete line press  `ESC`  and then write  `dd`  and press  `ENTER`*
        
    -   If the file is missing after rebooting, try using the filename  `/jffs/configs/dnsmasq.d/dnsmasq.conf`
        
3.  Add configuration for resolving domain names into  `dnsmasq.conf.add`
    
    -   Resolve one domain to IP,  _Explanation: resolves  `test.com`  domain to ip  `127.0.0.1`  or  `::1`  when on ipv6_
        
        ```
          address=/test.com/127.0.0.1
          address=/test.com/::1
        
        ```
        
    -   Resolve more domains to same IP,  _Explanation: resolves listed domains to ip  `127.0.0.1`  (you can write more)_
        
        ```
          address=/test1.com/test2.com/127.0.0.1
        
        ```
        
    -   **To save and quit editor**  quit typing with  `ESC`  and write  `:wq`  and hit  `ENTER`
        

## Last steps

1.  Reboot router with  `reboot`  command in ssh or through web interface. (Rebooting is not strictly necessary; restarting the  `dnsmasq`  service is sufficient:  `service restart_dnsmasq`)
2.  Go to  `Administration -> System`  and disable  `Enable SSH`  config option
